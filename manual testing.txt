SDLC : Software Development Life Cycle

Software Development Life Cycle is a process used by software industry to design , develop and test software's.
People
Process
Product

Requirement Analysis
Design
Development
Testing
Maintainance

Waterfall Model : 
Requirement Analysis
System Design
Implementation
Testing
Deployment
Maintanance

Advantage of Waterfall Model : 
1.Quality of product will be good.
2.Since Rwquirement changes are not allowed, changes of finding bugs will be less.
3.Initial invesment is less since the tester are hired at the later stages.
4.Preferred for small projects where requirement are freezed.

Disadvantages of waterfall model : 
1.Requirement changes are not allowed.
2.If there is defect in REquirement that will be continued in later phases.
Total investment is more because time taking for rework on defect is time consuming which leads to high investment.
Testing will startc only after coding.

Spiral Model : 
Spiral Model is Iterative model.
Spiral model overcome drawdacks of waterfall model.
We follow spiral model whenever there is dependency on the modules.
In every cycle new software will be released to customer.
Software will be released in multiple versions. So it is called version control model.

Advantages of Spiral Model : 
Testing is done in every cycle , before going to next cycle.
Customer will get to use the software for every module.
Requirement changes are allowed after every cycle before going to next cycle.

Disadvantages of Spiral model :
Requirement changes are not allowed in between the cycle.
Every cycle of spiral model looks like waterfall model.
There is no testing in requirement and design phase.


Agile model/ Agile Methodology/ Agile Process

It is an Iterative and Incremental Approach.

Agile is an Iterative and Incremental Process.

Deliver Software in Piece of requirements : 

Prototype Model : 
Initial requirements from the customer ---> Prototype ----> Customer ----> Design, Coding, Testing ....

Modules : 
Gmail : 
login
inbox
compose
sent
receive mail  etc

Banking : 
Login
Check Balance
Fund transfer
Req Statement
Add Payee
etc

V- Model/ VV Model :

Static Testing : 
Testing the project related documents is called as static testing.
Review
Walthrough
inspection

Dynamic Testing : 
Testing the actual software.
Unit testing
Integeration
System testing 
UAT


Verification and Validation : 
Verification checks whether we bulding the right product.
Focus on Documentation.
Verification typically involves.
Reviews
Walkthrough
Inspections

Validation : 
Checks whether we are bulding the product right.
Focus on software
Validation typically involves actual testing.
Unit testing, integeration, system testing. UAT testing.

Advantages : 
Testing is involve in each and every phase.

Disadvantage : 
Documentation is more
Initial investment is more.

Agile Principles : 

1. Customers no need to wait fir long time.
2. We develop , test and release piece of software to the customer with few number of features.
3.We can accept /accomodate requirement changes.


There Will be good communication between Customer, Business Analyst, Developer and Testers.
 
Advantages : 
Requirement changes are allowed in any stage of development or we can accomodate requirement changes in the middle of development.
Release will be very fast.
Customer no need to wait for long time.
Good communication between teams.
It is very easy model to adopt.

Disadvantages : 
Less Focus on design and documentation since we deliver software very faster.


Agile is defined process.

Scrum : kind of framework

Scrum is a framework through which we build software product by following Agile Principles.
Scrum includes group of people calles as Scrum team. Norammly contains 5-9 members.

1. Product Owner
2. Scrum Master
3. Dev Team
4. QA  Team


Product Owner : 
	Define the features of the product
	Prioritize features according to the market value
	Adjust features and priority  on every iteration , as needed.
	Accept or reject work results.

Scrum Master : 
	The main role is faciliating and driving the agile process.
	
Deevelopers and QA : 
	Develop and Test the software


Scrum Terminology : 
User Story : A feature/module in a software

Epic : Collection of user stories

Product Backlog : Contains list of user stories. Prepared by Product Owner.

Sprint/Iteration  : Period of time to complete the user stories, decided b y the product owner and team , usually 2-4 week of time.

Sprint planning meeting : Meeting conducts with the team to define what can be delivered in the sprint and duration.

Sprint Backlog : List of commited stories by Dev/QA for specific sprint.

Scrum Meeting :  Meeting conducted by Scrum master everday 15 mins. Called as Scrum call/ Standup meeting.
		What did you do yesterday ?
		what will you do today?
		Are there any impediments in your way?

Sprint retrospective meeting  : conducts meeting after completion of sprint. The entire team , including both the Scrummaster and the product owner should participate.

Story point : Rough estimation of user stoires , will be given by Dev and QA in the form of Fibonacci Series.

0 1 1 2 3 5 8 ......

1 story point  = 1 hour / 1 day(6 hour)
Login -----> Dev - 5 QA - 3  = 8 hours/ 1 day

Burndown chart : Shows how much work remaining in the sprint. Maintained by the scrum master daily.
